project-1-personnel-management-carlosj created by GitHub Classroom

This branch inside this directory contains:

  Code that implements a binary tree of strings
  A program with a simple user interface to add, remove, and print the strings
  
This branch contains the following files: pocahontas.h: header file of Node structure and the interface,
pocahontas.c: the implementation of the interface methods, the Makefile, and the text file where the names are written.


To compile:

  $ make

To run it:

  $ ./TreeDemo
  
To delete binaries:

  $ make clean
  
Things to figure out
1. Look at the header file to see what the structure contains and what the methods are supposed to do.

2. Look at the c file to see the code and logic of how the methods are implemented.
  The code is littered with comments, which explain all what every single line of code does.
  
3. Take a look at the make file to see what is being done and what calling make all, make clean, do.

Discussed approaches and compilation erros with Edward Seymour.
